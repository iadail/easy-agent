# easy-agent

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

`easy-agent` is a white-box Python foundation for building agent systems that you can actually inspect, test, and extend.

It is not a business-specific app. It is the runtime layer underneath one. The project gives you a stable place to run single agents, sub-agents, multi-agent graphs, teams, tools, skills, MCP servers, plugins, and now long-running harnesses without hard-coding product logic into the framework.

Current release line: `0.3.x`. This snapshot documents patch release `0.3.2`.

## What This Project Is

Many agent repositories jump straight from "call a model" to "ship a product". That makes the middle messy: tool calling drifts, long tasks become prompt soup, state is hard to resume, and protocol changes leak into business code.

`easy-agent` exists to keep that middle layer explicit.

- It separates runtime engineering from business logic.
- It keeps orchestration visible instead of hiding it behind opaque abstractions.
- It lets you mount new tools, skills, MCP servers, and plugins without rewriting the core.
- It gives long-running work a real harness instead of relying on one giant prompt.

## Who It Is For

- Teams building agent products that need a reusable runtime, not a one-off demo.
- Engineers who want direct control over scheduling, tools, state, and protocol adaptation.
- Projects that need to evolve with provider APIs, tool schemas, MCP, or multi-agent patterns over time.

## What You Get

- A white-box runtime with explicit `scheduler`, `orchestrator`, `registry`, `storage`, and `protocol adapter` layers.
- One runtime for `single_agent`, `sub_agent`, graph workflows, and `Agent Teams`.
- A first-class long-running harness with `initializer -> worker -> evaluator` loops, resumable checkpoints, and durable artifacts.
- A unified model-call surface for `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, and `Gemini` style payloads.
- A Tool Calling 2.0 runtime that can host direct tools, command skills, Python hook skills, MCP tools, and mounted plugins.
- Built-in session memory, tracing, event streaming, guardrails, human approvals, replay tooling, A2A-style federation, isolated workbench execution, and public evaluation helpers.

## Features

- Explicit runtime layering so the scheduler, orchestrator, tool registry, storage, and protocol adapters stay inspectable.
- Unified protocol adaptation for `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, and `Gemini` style model payloads.
- Tool Calling 2.0 support for direct tools, command skills, Python hook skills, MCP tools, and plugin mounting.
- `single_agent`, `sub_agent`, `multi_agent_graph`, and `Agent Teams` collaboration modes.
- Long-running harnesses with durable artifacts, explicit completion contracts, evaluator-driven continue or replan decisions, resumable checkpoints, and approval-aware resume gates.
- Session-oriented memory for direct runs, top-level teams, and harness state reuse.
- Human approval workflows plus safe-point interrupts for sensitive tools, swarm handoffs, harness resumes, and MCP sampling or elicitation requests.
- Guardrail hooks before tool execution and before final output emission.
- Schema-aware tool validation with a repair loop when the model emits invalid arguments.
- Event streaming and tracing across agent, team, tool, guardrail, harness, and MCP boundaries.
- SQLite plus JSONL persistence for runs, traces, checkpoints, session state, harness state, approval requests, interrupts, and resume lineage.
- Historical checkpoint listing, time-travel replay, and branchable `--fork` resume for graph and team workflows.
- A2A-style remote agent federation with exported local targets, remote inspection, task send or stream flows, durable task state, and CLI federation tooling.
- Executor and workbench isolation for long-lived command skills, MCP subprocesses, execution manifests, TTL cleanup, and fork-safe resume snapshots.
- MCP roots, sampling, elicitation, `streamable_http`, and authorization-aware remote transports with persisted OAuth state.
- Public evaluation helpers for BFCL subset cases and tau2 mock cases.

## Human Loop, Replay, and MCP

The current runtime already ships the reliability controls that were previously only listed as roadmap work.

- Sensitive tools can pause for human approval before execution, and swarm handoffs plus harness resumes can pause on the same human loop.
- Runs expose safe-point interrupts, approval queues, checkpoint listing, historical replay, and branchable `resume --fork` flows.
- MCP integrations now support explicit roots, backward-compatible filesystem root inference for stdio servers, sampling callbacks, elicitation callbacks, `streamable_http`, and auth-aware remote transports with persisted OAuth state.
- The CLI exposes `approvals`, `checkpoints`, `replay`, `interrupt`, `mcp roots`, and `mcp auth` commands so these controls are usable without custom code.

## A2A Remote Agent Federation

`easy-agent` now ships a more durable A2A-style federation layer instead of a polling-only bridge.

- `federation.server` can publish local agents, teams, or harnesses as exported targets.
- `federation.remotes` can inspect remote cards and prefer SSE push or fall back to polling with `push_preference = auto|sse|poll`.
- Federated delivery now includes persisted task event logs, SSE event streaming, webhook push delivery, retry with backoff, lease renewal, cancellation, and terminal delivery tracking for `SubscribeToTask` style lifecycles.
- `agent-card` and `extended-agent-card` now expose protocol version, card schema version, modalities, declared capabilities, auth hints, retry policy, subscribe policy, and compatibility metadata.
- Federated task state plus subscription state is persisted in SQLite so remote execution and push delivery can be inspected after the initial request completes.
- The CLI now exposes `easy-agent federation list|inspect|tasks|events|subscriptions|renew-subscription|cancel-subscription|serve`.

Example shape:

```yaml
federation:
  server:
    enabled: true
    host: <LOCAL_HOST>
    port: 8787
    base_path: /a2a
    public_url: https://agent.example.com/a2a
    protocol_version: "0.3"
    card_schema_version: "1.0"
    retry_max_attempts: 4
    retry_initial_backoff_seconds: 0.5
  exports:
    - name: repo_delivery
      target_type: harness
      target: delivery_loop
      modalities: [text]
      capabilities: [streaming, interrupts]
  remotes:
    - name: partner
      base_url: https://partner.example.com/a2a
      push_preference: auto
      auth:
        type: bearer_env
        token_env: PARTNER_AGENT_TOKEN
```

## Executor / Workbench Isolation

The runtime now has a dedicated executor or workbench layer for long-lived code execution, tool runs, and environment tasks.

- `WorkbenchManager` provisions per-run isolated roots under `.easy-agent/workbench` and persists backend runtime state alongside each session.
- `executors` now support `process`, `container`, and `microvm` backends behind the same workbench interface.
- Command skills and stdio MCP servers can opt into a named executor through `skill.metadata.executor` or `mcp[*].executor` and then reuse the same long-lived session.
- Graph and harness checkpoints capture workbench manifests, and forked resume clones those manifests into new session roots without discarding the original lineage.
- SQLite persists `workbench_sessions`, `workbench_executions`, runtime-state payloads, federated task state, and executor reuse metadata for later inspection.
- The real-network suite now exercises process reuse directly and reports container or microVM rows as host-gated `skipped` until images and SSH assets are provisioned.
- The CLI now exposes `easy-agent workbench list` and `easy-agent workbench gc`.

## Architecture

The runtime is intentionally white-box. The important layers are visible and replaceable.

- `scheduler` runs direct-agent and graph workflows.
- `harness` runs long tasks through explicit initializer, worker, and evaluator phases.
- `orchestrator` executes agent and team turns.
- `registry` exposes direct tools, skills, MCP tools, and mounted plugin tools.
- `storage` persists runs, traces, checkpoints, session state, and harness state.
- `protocol adapters` normalize provider-specific request and response shapes.

## Long-Running Harness Design

Long-running work should not depend on a single giant prompt. In this repository, a harness is a first-class runtime capability.

Each harness defines:

- an `initializer_agent`
- a `worker_target` that can be an agent or a team
- an `evaluator_agent`
- an explicit `completion_contract`
- durable artifact paths
- bounded `max_cycles` and `max_replans`

The harness writes three durable files per session:

- `bootstrap.md`: human-readable kickoff and recovery instructions
- `progress.md`: cycle-by-cycle progress log
- `features.json`: machine-readable state, decisions, and counters

### Harness Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start Run] --> Init[Initializer]
    Init --> Files[Write Bootstrap and State Files]
    Files --> Worker[Worker]
    Worker --> Eval[Evaluator]
    Eval -->|CONTINUE| Worker
    Eval -->|REPLAN| Init
    Eval -->|COMPLETE| Finish[Finish Run]
```

The harness design is informed by Anthropic's article [Effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) published on November 26, 2025. The key idea is simple: long tasks need explicit coordination code, clear completion checks, and recoverable artifacts, not just a stronger model.

## Protocol and Tool Model

### Model Protocols

- `OpenAI` style payloads, including OpenAI-compatible providers such as DeepSeek.
- `Anthropic` style payloads.
- `Gemini` style payloads.

### Tool Calling 2.0 Runtime

The runtime can expose tools from multiple sources through one registry:

- direct in-process tools
- command skills
- Python hook skills
- MCP tools over `stdio`, `HTTP/SSE`, or `streamable_http`
- mounted plugins from local paths, manifests, or entry points

```

## Quick Start

### Environment

```powershell
uv venv --python 3.12
uv sync --dev
```

### Local Credentials

The runtime auto-loads a local-only `.env.local` file. This keeps machine-specific secrets out of tracked files while avoiding repeated manual exports.

Example:

```dotenv
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key
PG_HOST=<LOCAL_HOST>
PG_PORT=5432
PG_USER=postgres
PG_PASSWORD=your-password
PG_DATABASE=postgres
REDIS_URL=redis://<LOCAL_HOST>:6379/0
```

### Common Commands

```powershell
uv run easy-agent doctor -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent skills list -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent plugins list -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent teams list -c configs/teams.example.yml
uv run easy-agent harness list -c configs/harness.example.yml
uv run easy-agent federation list -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent workbench list -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent run "summarize the repository" --session-id demo-session --approval-mode deferred -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent approvals list --status pending -c easy-agent.yml
uv run easy-agent checkpoints <run_id> -c configs/teams.example.yml
uv run easy-agent replay <run_id> --checkpoint-id <checkpoint_id> -c configs/teams.example.yml
uv run easy-agent resume <run_id> --checkpoint-id <checkpoint_id> --fork -c configs/teams.example.yml
uv run easy-agent interrupt <run_id> --reason "human stop" -c configs/teams.example.yml
uv run easy-agent harness run delivery_loop "Create a release summary for this repository" -c configs/harness.example.yml --session-id demo-harness --approval-mode deferred
uv run easy-agent harness resume <run_id> -c configs/harness.example.yml --approval-mode deferred
uv run easy-agent mcp roots list filesystem -c configs/longrun.example.yml
uv run easy-agent mcp auth status filesystem -c configs/longrun.example.yml
```

### Python Runtime Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

from agent_runtime.runtime import build_runtime

runtime = build_runtime('configs/harness.example.yml')
runtime.load(Path('skills/examples'))
runtime.load('third_party_plugin')
```

## What a Harness Run Produces

A successful harness run does more than return text.

- It persists run metadata and checkpoints in SQLite.
- It streams runtime events for CLI or observer consumption.
- It writes `bootstrap.md`, `progress.md`, and `features.json` so a later run can resume from explicit state.
- It can reuse prior harness state when you pass the same `--session-id`.

## Verification

The repository currently uses these verification paths on this machine:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check src tests scripts
.\.venv\Scripts\mypy.exe src tests scripts
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/unit -q --basetemp=%TEMP%\easy-agent-pytest\unit-full-<timestamp>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/integration -m real -q --basetemp=%TEMP%\easy-agent-pytest\integration-full-<timestamp>
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\benchmark_modes.py --config easy-agent.yml --repeat 1 --output .easy-agent\benchmark-report.json
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -  # helper script calling run_public_eval_suite('easy-agent.yml')
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -  # helper script calling run_real_network_suite()
```

Python CLI smoke is also verified through `CliRunner` against `agent_cli.app:app` for `--help`, `doctor`, `teams list`, `harness list`, and `federation list`.

Source: `.easy-agent/public-eval-report.json` regenerated during the March 27, 2026 live verification pass.

Current caveats:

- The live suite still emits Windows `asyncio` subprocess cleanup warnings after completion, but the real tests and generated reports completed successfully.
- DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible endpoint still returns provider-side `400 Bad Request` responses on a subset of BFCL multiple and irrelevance cases even after union-schema flattening; the harness and MCP-backed long-run workflows now pass end to end.
- Container and microVM executor rows remain host-gated until `EASY_AGENT_CONTAINER_IMAGE`, `EASY_AGENT_QEMU_BASE_IMAGE`, and `EASY_AGENT_QEMU_SSH_KEY` are provisioned.

## Next Reinforcement

These next steps are based on the current public A2A and MCP protocol surfaces, not just internal backlog notes.

- Align federation discovery and task delivery more closely with the public A2A surface, including well-known discovery, `pushNotification/set|get`, and reconnect-safe `sendSubscribe` or resubscribe behavior.
- Extend federation card negotiation toward richer transport and security metadata, including clearer auth scheme hints, artifact or part-level modality declarations, and stricter compatibility negotiation for server-to-client notifications.
- Expand MCP capability negotiation from basic roots support to full `roots/list_changed` flows plus stronger `streamable_http` reconnect and auth-refresh handling.
- Make MCP sampling and elicitation policies more granular by separating low-risk and high-risk remote requests, and by supporting richer form or URL elicitation result handling without bypassing human approval.
- Turn the current host-gated `container` and `microvm` executor backends into provisioned flows with image bootstrap, snapshot or restore, resource quotas, and repeatable real-host validation so those matrix rows move from `skipped` to exercised.
- Extend the real-network suite with mixed live-model federation runs, duplicate-delivery or replay resilience checks, and real container or microVM reuse scenarios once host assets are available.
